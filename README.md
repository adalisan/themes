This repository is an aggregation of **Terminal** and **iTerm** color schemes. 

Color Schemes or Themes are what actually defines what colors are being used in your terminal. This is a very important way to customize the UI of your terminal.

## Installation

If you haven’t changed the default terminal theme you must still be gazing in to the snowy wasteland that is the default. This is insane. Programmers are incompatible with white backgrounds. Er, except in blogs. *cough*

Changing the terminal theme is marginally trickier than it should be. After running the theme that you wish to apply a new terminal window will open with that theme, however it will not be the **default** theme. To make the theme stick then this is how you do it:

### Terminal

- Go to Terminal → Preferences…
- Select the Settings group.
- Pick something nice that doesn’t sear your retinas.
- At the bottom of the list box, click Default so that new terminals will open with the selected colour scheme.

### iTerm

- Go to iTerm → Preferences…
- Select the profile group → Colors
- Choose the `Load Preset` dropdown and you will see a list of themes you have loaded
- Select the name of the preset and you are good to go.

The `sources` folder contain the following themes repositories fetched:

- [Tomorrow-theme](https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme)
- [Flat-terminal](https://github.com/ahmetsulek/flat-terminal)
- [iTerm2-color-schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes)
- [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized)
- [Dracula](https://github.com/zenorocha/dracula-theme)

The repositories integrated are defined as submodules and the themes are extracted, aggregated and classified into two folder: `terminal` for terminal specific themes and `iTerm` for iTerm themes.

I will be adding new themes and modules, so watch this repo :)
