This repository is an aggregation of **Terminal** and **iTerm** color schemes. 

The `sources` folder contain the following themes repositories fetched:

- [Tomorrow-theme](https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme)
- [Flat-terminal](https://github.com/ahmetsulek/flat-terminal)
- [iTerm2-color-schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes)
- [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized)

The repositories integrated are defined as submodules and the themes are extracted, aggregated and classified into two folder: `terminal` for terminal specific themes and `iTerm` for iTerm themes.

I will be adding new themes and modules, so watch this repo :)
